    I made this site for proof of my concept at
    <a href="https://github.com/blog/1450-the-github-data-challenge-ii" target="_blank">The GitHub Data Challenge II</a>.
    <br>
    Amazing thing happened. This project placed in second on
    <a href="https://github.com/blog/1544-data-challenge-ii-results" target="_blank">Data Challenge II Results</a>
    and a lot of people like my idea.<br>
    So, I decided to serve as a service and aggregate more convention data continuously.<br>
    I reseted convention data at all and aggregate newly since old data structure isn't efficient and has some bugs.<br>
    And convention data can be reset sometimes when I found some bugs.

    Please leave issues on <a href="https://github.com/outsideris/popularconvention/issues" target="_target">Github</a>
    if you have some problems or opinion.<br>
    Thank you for your interest.
